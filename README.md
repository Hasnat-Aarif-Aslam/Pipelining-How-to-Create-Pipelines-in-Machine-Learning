# Pipelining-How-to-Create-Pipelines-in-Machine-Learning
# By Hasnat Aarif Aslam

In this repository, I have tried to make pipelines using Pipeline and make_pipeline along with ColumnTransformer and suitable Estimator. At the end of the notebook, a complete working example of a pipeline on a dataset is shown along with the predictions on a new dataset.

In Hyperparameter Tuning with pipelining.ipynb, I have tried to show how Hyperparameters can be adjusted with the help of GridSearchCV along the Pipelines.
